\format{
Contains seven column, as follows:
\describe{
  \item{tree.id}{Tree number identificator. An unique number to each 
  sample tree.}
  \item{forest}{Forest type.}
  \item{habitat}{Forest habitat type.}
  \item{tree.code}{A composite tree code representing the following
   columns: tree.id-forest-habitat}
  \item{age}{Age, in yr}

Originally, the data were provided by Dr Albert Stage (R.I.P) to 
Professor Andrew Robinson (University
of Idaho, USA), whom used them to explain the fitting of statistical
 models. Dr Christian Salas-Eljatib was a former graduate student of 
 Statistics of Prof Robinson at the University of Idaho.
