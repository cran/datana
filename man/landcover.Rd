data(landcover)
}
\description{
dataset contains 476 observations, 34 categorical and 442 numerical.
 Land-cover data was generated through remote 
sensing classification techniques using Sentinel-2 satellite images 
from year 2016. Temperatures were obtained from 
TIRS band 10 of Landsat 8 satellites images. Particulate matter
 concentrations were estimated using spatial modelling
techniques from 10 pollution stations distributed in the city.
 Altitude was generated from a Digital Elevation Model. 
Population and poverty were gathered from Casen 2017 survey.
