\description{
These are plot-level measurement (2x2 m) data from the forests in the 
Robinson Crusoe Island, located
 in the Pacific Ocean, 667 km from mainland Chile. Measurements were
  collected in transects 
 of 100 to 240 meters in which, 398 squared plots (2x2 m) were set to
  include canopy gaps, 
 gap borders and closed forest conditions.
