\title{Performs a likelihood ratio test between two models being
fitted by maximum likelihood.}
\usage{
lrt(
  llma = llma,
  llmb = llmb,
  qa = qa,
  qb = qb,
  nfit = nfit,
  modA = "modA",
  modB = "modB",
  alpha = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{llma}{maximized log-likelihood of the reduced model (or
modA).}

\item{llmb}{maximized log-likelihood of the more-complex model (or
modB).}

\item{qa}{the number of parameters of the reduced model.}

\item{qb}{the number of parameters of the more-complex model.}

\item{nfit}{the sample size used for fitted both models.}

\item{modA}{is a character with a name to be assigned to object
modA.}

\item{modB}{is a character with a name to be assigned to object
modB.}

\item{alpha}{is the level of sifnificance to used for computing
as a reference only, the tabulated value of the respective
Chi-Squared statistic. By the defaul is set to 0.05.}
}
\value{
This function wraps two outputs: (i) a table that computes
the AIC, BIC and AICc goodness-of-fit statistics for both models,
and (ii) the result of the likelihood ratio test, such as the
value of the statistic being computed, its respective p-value,
and the tabulated value of the statistics using the a defined
alpha significance of level.
}
\description{
Function to perform a likelihood ratio test (LRT) between a
reduced model (modA) versus a more complex model (modB),
provided both models were fitted by maximum likelihood. The
function requires to be filled with the needed values used
to perform a LRT.
}
\details{
The resulting output offers statistical inference
estimates of the LRT, as well as other maximum likelihood-based
statistics. Notice that the function only works if the number
of parameters for modA is lower than the ones of modB.
