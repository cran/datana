\title{Remeasurements of a permanent sample plot in a radiata pine plantation (Chile).}
\format{
The data frame contains the following columns:
\describe{
\item{plot.no}{plot id}	 
\item{tree.no}{tree id}
\item{dbh}{Diameter at breast-height, in cm.}
\item{year}{Measurement year.} 											
\item{x}{Cartesian position at the X-axis, in m.}
\item{y}{Cartesian position at the Y-axis, in m.}
\item{dead}{if the tree is dead,this column is equal to 1, and 0 otherwise.}
 }

\description{
Annual remeasurements of trees within a 1600 m\eqn{^{2}}{^2} permanent sample plot established in a radiata pine
 plantation in Chile. Besides, the trees location are available.  The plot is square (40 m Ã— 40 m), and
 if a tree is found dead, the column dead=1.
